# Quark Star in f(RT) Gravity

Source code for Quark star in f(R,T) = R + alpha R^2 + omega RT gravity. 						 
														
The main purpose of the code is to identify the central value of Ricci scalar R_c correspoding to a given central density. The equation of state of the matter is given by the bag model, with pressure expressed as p = k(epsilon - 4B), where B representing the bag.								 
 														 	
Initially the code solves the starobinsky gravity to identify the correct central value of Ricci scalar. Then using this value the main will calulate correct value of R_c for R + alpha R^2 + omega RT gravity.

The result of this code is published in: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjc%2Fs10052-020-8130-4
